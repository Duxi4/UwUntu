"Ubuntu Budgie is a modern computer operating system, with an attractive and "
"easy to understand user interface. Its update manager keeps not only the "
"operating system itself, but all of its installed applications updated to "
"the current release. The operating system is more secure, and better "
"supported than operating systems that come pre-installed on most home "
"computer hardware today."

"Ubuntu Budgie is designed with security in mind. Unlike operating systems "

"The updates include security patches for Ubuntu Budgie and all of its "
"components. Security updates for all of its installed applications are also "
"provided on the same schedule. This ensures that you have the latest "
"protection for all of your computer's software -- as soon as it's available!"

"Ubuntu Budgie can get viruses and other infections... but it is rare. Rapid "
"and timely updates make it difficult for viruses, root kits and other "
"malware to be installed and run without conscious intervention by you, the "
"user. Even if you do accidentally invite in an infection, chances are it's "
"designed to attack Windows and won't do much, if any damage to Ubuntu "
"Budgie."

"Another significant security feature of Ubuntu Budgie is that its users are "
"not superusers by default. Superusers (also known as \"root\" users or "
"administrators) on any computer system have permission to do anything they "
"want, including the ability to damage the system."

"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. Ubuntu Budgie "
"opens a file based on what the file is, not based on its name. So even if a "
"malicious program disguises its identity by using the name \"Last Will and "
"Testament.txt\" Ubuntu Budgie will recognize the file as a program. The "
"system provides a warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a"
" program that will be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra"
" secure, Ubuntu Budgie requires you to provide your administrator password "
"before that permission is granted. Every single time."
