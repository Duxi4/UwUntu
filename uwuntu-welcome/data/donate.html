          <p>&zwnj;<strong>UwUntu</strong> is a GNU/Linux distribution
          that combines the powerful Ubuntu base with the beautiful Budgie Desktop to provide a user
          friendly, modern desktop operating system.&zwnj;</p>

          <p>&zwnj;The goal of UwUntu is to provide a stable operating system that offers
          a weaboo user experience, and usable for both newbies and advanced users alike. We don't get
          any funding from Canonical (the company that pays for Ubuntu up-keep and development).&zwnj;</p>

          <p>&zwnj;This whole project has been done by two students who wanted to have fun with something different related to what we were studying.
            In this process we fell in love with Linux and now we are planning to take this as a serious project, adding even more customization and support to other graphical environments.
            If youâ€™d like to contribute to this project, knowledge about Linux is always welcome, and if you would like to support us even more a donation will always be appreciated.&zwnj;</p>

          <p>&zwnj;If you believe that our cause is worthy and it is something that needs to go
          on without any barriers, then please consider contributing to the project.&zwnj;</p>
