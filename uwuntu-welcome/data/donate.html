          <p>&zwnj;<strong>Ubuntu Budgie</strong> is a community driven GNU/Linux distribution
          that combines the powerful Ubuntu base with the beautiful Budgie Desktop to provide a user
          friendly, modern desktop operating system.&zwnj;</p>

          <p>&zwnj;The goal of Ubuntu Budgie is to provide a stable operating system that offers
          a familiar user experience, and usable for both newbies and advanced users alike. We are part of the
          official Ubuntu community, which provides for you better visibility and support. However we don't get
          any funding from Canonical (the company that pays for Ubuntu up-keep and development).&zwnj;</p>

          <p>&zwnj;Ubuntu Budgie is an open source project and any money raised will
          be used to meet maintenance costs of the project, support the project and give back to all projects that
          make up Ubuntu Budgie. Every contributor will be displayed proudly on our website.
          How your money is spent is displayed so you can be assured your contributions are being used wisely.
          Patreon donations will be made visible on confirmation
          of the donation received at the beginning of the next month. Paypal donations will appear ASAP
          after the donation is received.&zwnj;</p>

          <p>&zwnj;If you believe that our cause is worthy and it is something that needs to go
          on without any barriers, then please consider contributing to the project.&zwnj;</p>
